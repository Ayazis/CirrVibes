### Plan for Limited 3D Web Version of "Achtung die Kurve"

#### 1. Set Up Project Structure
- Create an `index.html` file for the game interface.
- Add a `style.css` file for styling.
- Include a `script.js` file for game logic.
- Use WebGL for rendering the 3D game environment.

#### 2. Design Game Interface
- Design a canvas element where WebGL will render the game.
- Add controls for players to start the game and assign keys for movement.

#### 3. Implement Game Logic
- Implement the core mechanics:
  - Players control 3D objects (e.g., lines or vehicles) that move continuously.
  - Lines/vehicles turn left or right based on player input.
  - Collision detection for objects and boundaries.
- Add a scoring system to determine the winner.

#### 4. Integrate 3D Rendering with WebGL
- Create a simple 3D environment with a flat plane as the game area.
- Render player-controlled 3D objects (e.g., lines or vehicles).
- Use a top-down camera to simulate the GTA2-like view.
- Optimize WebGL shaders for smooth performance.

#### 5. Add Multiplayer Support
- Allow multiple players to play on the same keyboard.
- Optionally, explore adding online multiplayer functionality in the future.

#### 6. Test and Debug
- Test the game mechanics and WebGL rendering.
- Debug any issues with collision detection, controls, or rendering.

#### 7. Add Optional Enhancements
- Add sound effects and animations.
- Include a menu screen with game instructions.
- Implement different game modes or power-ups.
- Add textures or lighting effects for a more immersive experience.
