# Performance Refactor TODO List

- [ ] Analyze current code for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Fix trail loop bug (iterate over player.trail[i] objects, not (cx, cy) parms)
- [x] Disable depth test; enable blending only when needed
- [x] Cache projectionMatrix/modelViewMatrix; compute once and on resize only
- [x] Change dynamic buffers to gl.DYNAMIC_DRAW and use bufferSubData with pooled Float32Array
- [x] Make walls static VBO/IBO prepared outside the frame loop
- [ ] Replace mat4.create() allocation strategy with a static identity or pooled matrices
- [x] Implement typed-array pooling for trail segments
- [x] Apply buffer orphaning pattern for dynamic buffers
- [x] Remove color buffer; use uniform baseColor and compute gradient in shader
- [x] Use VAOs (WebGL2) or emulate with binding order (WebGL1)
- [x] Decide on rendering model: Option B (instanced segments)
- [x] Implement chosen rendering model for trails (instanced segments: start/end points, quad expansion in shader)
- [ ] Refactor game logic to use fixed timestep update
- [ ] Implement occupancy grid for O(1) collision tests
- [ ] Use ring buffers for trails; cap stored points per player
- [ ] Make canvas Hi-DPI aware and handle resize
- [ ] Separate GL state initialization from draw loop
- [ ] Minimize GL state changes per frame
- [ ] Test and verify performance improvements
